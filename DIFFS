Differences from rioutil-1.10a:
 - Add compatibility mode option: -x
   Used by default for devices with old firmware and optionally 
   by user to avoid weird behavior seen with dummy file headers. 
   Using this option disables audio files (mp3/wma) from being 
   downloaded from the device.
 - Changed the --info and --list options to respect the --memory option
   and only print the info/list for the specified memory unit.
 - When using usbdevfs, the --device option can be used to specify
   a particular device in 0xXXXXYYYY format where XXXX is the 
   four digit hexadecimal USB vendor ID and YYYY is the four digit 
   hexadecimal USB product ID. 
 - Changed to exit with status of 0 upon success and 1 on error
   in order to allow better control from scripts.
 - Changed to use get_mp3_info function from mp3info 
   in order to solve problems in decoding mp3 headers.
   Added mp3tech.c and mp3tech.h files from mp3info.
 - Improved error checking and error messages.
 - Added 1ms delay during transfers in compatibility mode
   to avoid device lock ups with older firmware.
 - Reset device in case of read_bulk timeout error in order 
   to prevent device from getting locked up.  This avoids 
   having to remove the battery pack to get the device 
   working again.  Added usb_reset function to usbdrvlinux.c.
