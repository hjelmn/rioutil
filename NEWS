Jan    2003 : S-Series Rios and Rio Riots should work with the latest
            version of rioutil (1.3).

Feb 19 2002 : I think that the final major bug it finally squashed
	    therefor the releases beyond 1.2 will be few and will
	    only be small bugfix releases. I will work on documenting
	    librioutil.

	    Again, get the latest from CVS or tarball:
	    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rioutil

Apr 25 2001 : rioutil was approved by sourceforge . I will now
	    continue development of this software and prepare it for
            libpdmp.

	    To get the latest distro goto: rioutil.sourceforge.net.

Feb 16 2001 : Firmware update is complete!! You must set a debug level
	     before it will work though.

Feb 04 2001 : Uploading now works!
