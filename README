** NOTE **
- If compiling from cvs, use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure.
- You probably want to install libusb and run configure with --with-libusb

rioutil is free software released under the terms of the LGPL (read LICENCE file).

******************************************************************************
% ./configure --with-libusb

*** libusb NOTES **
 - libusb is now the default driver so you no longer need to use this option.
 - to disable libusb use the option --without-libusb
 - For linux see usbdevfs notes becuase it is required before this method will.
work.
 - For darwin 5.x, 6.x or macos 10.x.x you will want libusb 1.6 or newer.

******************************************************************************
% ./configure --without-usbdevfs
% make

(as root)
% cp linux_driver/rio* /usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/
% cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/usb
% mv rios.c rio500.c
% cd /usr/src/linux
(add the rio500 module in configuration)
% make modules
% make modules_install
% insmod rio500

(and if you do not use devfs and the device file does not exist)
% mkdir /dev/usb
% mknod /dev/usb/rio0 c 180 64

The 64 is the base minor, if you have more than one rio add the minor
assigned by the driver (you can see the minor number in /var/log/messages).
i.e. :
<snip from /var/log/messages>
Device assigned minor 1
</snip>
% mknod /dev/usb/rio1 c 180 65

If you want firmware updates, please do not email me. I dont know
the legal issues with mirroring them, so if you want to get a hold of
one and can use stuffit expander (www.aladdinsys.com), you can download
the firmware designed for the mac from www.riohome.com (a .sit.hqx or .zip file).
Once this file is decompressed you should have a .lok file, this is the firmware.

08/30/2006: Current firmware versions:
rio600   : 1.56
rio600-64: 1.56
rio800   : 1.55
Riot     : 1.25
psa[play : 1.62

These players work with rioutil's firmware update only from the ready to recieve
firmware screen. A future version of rioutil will fix this known issue.
S-Series : 2.03
Fuse     : 1.12
Cali     : 2.43
Chiba    : 2.43

As far as I know, if you have any other player you probably have the latest
firmware version (if it was bought recently).

enjoy!
