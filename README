 - libusb is now the only availabke driver so you no longer need to specify an
   option to use libusb.
 - For darwin 5.x, 6.x or macos 10.x.x you will want libusb-1.0 1.0.9 or newer.

If you want firmware updates, please do not email me. I dont know
the legal issues with mirroring them, so if you want to get a hold of
one and can use stuffit expander (www.aladdinsys.com), you can download
the firmware designed for the mac from www.riohome.com (a .sit.hqx or .zip file).
Once this file is decompressed you should have a .lok file, this is the firmware.

www.riohome.com is no longer available. Firmware updates can probably be found
by searching the web. Below are the latest known versions for various players.

08/30/2006: Current firmware versions:
rio600   : 1.56
rio600-64: 1.56
rio800   : 1.55
Riot     : 1.25
psa[play : 1.62

These players work with rioutil's firmware update only from the ready to recieve
firmware screen. A future version of rioutil will fix this known issue.
S-Series : 2.03
Fuse     : 1.12
Cali     : 2.43
Chiba    : 2.43

As far as I know, if you have any other player you probably have the latest
firmware version (if it was bought recently).

enjoy!
